This web application allows users to visualize mathematical functions dynamically. Built with Streamlit, the app provides an interactive interface to plot functions in real-time by entering expressions for the variable x. The app supports a variety of mathematical functions, such as trigonometric functions (e.g., sin(x), cos(x), tan(x)), exponential and logarithmic functions, and more complex mathematical expressions.

**Features:**

        Input Function: Enter a mathematical function using x as the variable (e.g., sin(x), x**2 - 4).
        Interactive Controls: Adjust the x-axis range (X-axis Minimum, X-axis Maximum) and the number of points used to plot the function.
        Plot Generation: Click a button to generate a plot based on the provided function, with support for real-time updates and error handling.

**How to Use:**

        Enter a mathematical function in the input field (e.g., sin(x), x**2 - 4).
        Set the desired range for the x-axis and the number of points for plotting.
        Press the "Plot Function" button to generate the graph.
        View the graph with labeled axes, grid lines, and a legend.
        
**Technologies:**

        Streamlit for web interface.
        Matplotlib for plotting graphs.
        NumPy for mathematical operations.
